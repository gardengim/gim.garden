title: Let me introduce myself.
---

I have couple of things to say about myself.

I have couple names:
- Jeongwon Kim (김정원)
- Eric Kim
	- Some people spell my name "Erik" or "Erick", I don't really care. I kinda like "Erik" because I like listening to *Erik Satie*, but I always spell my name "Eric" because I used to.
