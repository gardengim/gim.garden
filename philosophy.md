Ok, so I have some sort of philosophy, kind of strict, could sound weird but yeah.
I call this philosophy but this more closer to my habits or some sort of stubbornness.

I like very clean, static, minimal, and simple design. Not just "design design" but in any sort of design-ness.

Even this website. I did not use any of JavaScript (well, I did, but not in the client-side).
