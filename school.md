title: My thoughts on higher education
---

well, not gonna lie,
I am kinda sick of higher education these days.

I am not sure if we are studying to "learn knowledge" or "earn score".
Of course, studying for exams and spending time on assignments are very important, to "learn". But most of the time, I find myself struggling to just "earn" credits. Using AI all the time, plagiarism is not a thing anymore.
Professors somehow use AI-detector and shockingly they shockingly revealed that The Declaration of Independence is actually AI-generated text.


Are we actually learning in college?
What are we doing here?
